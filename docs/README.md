## 💡 Philosophy

Lizard3D is a project that I wanted to start to simplify the way graphics and math works in [our game engine](https://compvisia.com/Lila/), and to reuse this project for future projects. Basically this is a foundation that allows anyone to build further.

Lizard3D is also made as a smaller project that you can work on if you feel a bit unmotivated.

Lizard3D also makes learning new things easier due to it's small project size.
